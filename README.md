# br_model
Beeler-Reuter (1977) ionic model of the ventricular cell (guinea pig).

A repo containing GPU-code (OpenACC) for numerical simulation of myocardium tissue using the Beeler-Reuter (1977) ionic model.

Model of the tissue is as simple as possible: 2D, constant gap junctions' conductivities and 1 type of cardiomyocytes.

Both discrete and continious media (i.e. "reaction-diffusion" or "cable equation") versions are possible.
