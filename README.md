BR: Beeler-Reuter (1977) ionic model of a ventricular cell (guinea pig).

GPU-code (OpenACC) for the numerical simulation of a myocardium tissue.

Model of the tissue: 
- 2D 
- constant gap junctions' conductivities 
- 1 type of cardiomyocytes present.

Both discrete and continious media (i.e. "reaction-diffusion" or "cable equation") versions are feasible.
