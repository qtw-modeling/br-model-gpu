# br_model

GPU-code (OpenACC) for numerical simulation of myocardium tissue using the Beeler-Reuter (1977) ionic model.

Model of the tissue: 
- 2D
- gap junctions' conductivities = const
- 1 type of cardiomyocytes present.

Calculations of both discrete and continious media's (i.e. reaction-diffusion/cable equation) models are feasible.
